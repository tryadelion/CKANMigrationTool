# CKANMigrationTool
KSP Migration Tool, modified by Tryadelion so it works with the new CKAN API.


## INSTRUCTIONS

download the MigrationToolPlugin.dll present in this folder and install it to CKAN through the **SETTINGS/CKAN PLUGINS** menu.

When a error / incompatibity / mod not found error pops in, restart CKAN to see the changes performed.

To see the mod list updated, close the plugin, wait for the repositories to fetch, then press big, blue, refresh button. automatically installed mods will be added.

Some mods do get updated nad merged into core and full projects, if a mod fails to install due to a dependency, search it and you'll probably find it. it happened to me with *INTERESTELLAR FUEL SWITCH*, wich had been renamed to core, and had another version released i installed that new version and it worked.


Hope you enjoy it!
